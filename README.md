# Cloud recommendation based on a selected company

The fictitious start-up _“Foodability”_ (10 employees) specializes in providing its customers with information about the __sustainability of various foods__ in terms of production, packaging, and transport via an app. This is intended to create transparency and guide the decision in favour of a more sustainable food. 

Foodability plans to procure a new __customer relationship management (CRM) system__. Currently, customer data is captured in __Microsoft Excel__. The possibility of using the hosted __cloud CRM HubSpot__ will now be analysed in the following section based on the advantages and disadvantages. 

With regard to the __hardware__ aspect, the introduction of HubSpot does not result in any initial investments. At Foodability, there is a need for __quickly scalable virtual resources__. The best-known advantage of cloud computing is scalability. Performance can be dynamically adjusted to the actual workload required by configuring virtual resources. This is a key difference to on-premise hosting, where a maximum of 100% of hardware performance is available. Specifically, on-premise hosting generates power loss at times when few hardware resources are needed. In addition, infinite virtual resources enable new evaluation methods such as Big Data.

In terms of __network security__, companies face major challenges when using cloud computing. A common cause of sensitive data being lost is the inadequate configuration of access rights to cloud data storage. As a result, data becomes freely accessible or visible to unauthorized people. In addition, applications transported to the cloud must actively support authentication and authorization. Because of the global visibility of these applications, inadequately secured applications can lead to major security risks. Even small security risks such as the use of insufficiently patched operating systems or outdated libraries can have serious consequences, as there are active scanners on the Internet that can precisely exploit such vulnerabilities and take over applications.

__Disaster recovery__ plans with cloud architecture are attractive for small and medium businesses. The response time with outages is very fast when using the cloud and usually takes no more than a few hours. In addition, companies can "outsource" their computing needs and continuity planning to cloud solution providers. A disadvantage of disaster recovery in the cloud is that there have already been many incidents where cloud solution providers have engaged in malpractice. Additionally, companies become dependent on cloud solution providers.

Often, the __total cost of the cloud__ is less than what you would have to spend on __storage/server usage, cooling, floor space, power, etc.__, on-site.

__Virtualization__ is the foundation of cloud computing and describes the use of software to create a layer of abstraction above the physical hardware. This so-called virtual computing system (virtual machine) enables companies to run multiple virtual computers, operating systems, and applications on a single physical server. This enables __more efficient use of physical computer hardware, and processes do not have to be interrupted to increase resources, update software__ or __replace hardware__.

The many advantages speak in favor of switching the CRM system in MS-Excel to HubSpot's cloud solution. The __public cloud as a deployment model__ is a suitable start for smaller companies with less to no existing hardware and software. The ultimate objective is the multitenant cloud to avoid vendor lock-in. HubSpot is a __Software as a Service (SaaS) application__ and is centrally hosted by the vendor. The user accesses the platform via the Internet browser.
